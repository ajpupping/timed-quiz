# Timed Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive timed quiz, using javascript, css, and html. 

I learned how to set a timer, use an event listener, and hide or show elements on demand. 


## Usage 

Users who [visit the Timed Quiz website](https://ajpupping.github.io/timed-quiz/) will find an interactive quiz where they can test their javascript knowledge.

Clicking the Start button will begin the quiz. A timer will count down and questions will be displayed one at a time.

If the player gets a question wrong, 10 seconds of time will be subtracted as a penalty.

After the quiz ends, the player may enter their name and view their high scores.
